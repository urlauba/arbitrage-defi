\
Hello! You've found my Arbitrage DeFi project!
\
\
The above is meant to serve as a notice. I'm writing this project soley for my own benefits. If not profitable, it will serve as good exercise that demonstrates my knowledge of Solidity. A project that I can showcase as part of my portfolio!
\
\
As such, I have zero plans to actively maintain this project, or support use for other members of the community, other than myself. There is no timeline.
It's my first project in Solidity, meaning security should be heavily scrutinized.
\
\
However, you're welcome to use this code as a resource as described by the LICENSE.
\
I hope you've found my code helpful! :slightly_smiling_face:

# Arbitrage DeFi

Details TBD
